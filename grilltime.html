<h2>Propane Tank Remaining Usage Calculator</h2>
I realized that I was probably replacing the propane tank on our grill with a full tank before we really needed to
because I was not sure how much longer it would last so I found out how to calculate the remaining time.

This is a very simple way to determine how much remaining time you have in the grill propane tank.
You need to know 3 numbers to do it:
<ul>
    <li>grill BTUs (how much gas it burns per hour), 12000 is a typical value</li>
    <li>empty tank weight, this should be written next to TW (tare weight) on the collar/top of the propane tank, 16.6 is typical</li>
    <li>current tank weight, get a bathroom scale and put the tank on it</li>
</ul>

<div ng-app="" ng-controller="calculateController">
    Empty tank weight: <input type="text" data-ng-model="weightempty" /> lbs (16.6 is typical)
    <br />
   <!-- Full tank weight: <input type="text" data-ng-model="weightfull" /> lbs
    <br />-->
    Grill BTUs: <input type="text" data-ng-model="btus" /> (no comma, 12000 is typical)
    <br />
    Current tank weight: <input type="text" data-ng-model="weightcurrent" /> lbs
    <br />

      Remaining gas: {{ (weightcurrent - weightempty) | number:1}} lbs
     <br />
      Remaining time: {{ ( ((weightcurrent-weightempty) * btusPerPound) / btus) | number:1 }} hours
</div>

<script>
    function calculateController($scope) {
        $scope.weightempty = "16.6";
        $scope.weightcurrent = "20";
        $scope.btus = "12000";
        $scope.btusPerPound = "21600"; <!-- btus per hour produced by one pound of propane -->
    }
</script>
